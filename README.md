# Sure Tomorrow Insurance

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project utilizes linear algebra and machine learning to find customers similar to given customers, as well as make predictions about the benefits that a new customer is likely to receive. It also demonstrates that it is possible to protect their customers' personal data through data obfuscation without breaking any machine learning models that they are using.
