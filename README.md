# Sure Tomorrow Insurance

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project utilizes linear algebra and machine learning to find customers similar to given customers, as well as make predictions about the benefits that a new customer is likely to receive. It also demonstrates that it is possible to protect their customers' personal data through data obfuscation without breaking any machine learning models that they are using.

<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.9.13 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebook, it can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.
